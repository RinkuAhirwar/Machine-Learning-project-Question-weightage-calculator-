# Machine-Learning-project-Question-weightage-calculator-
## ML Based project to classify the set of input questions and return weightage of chapter from which the question were input.
## Designed a model which take inputs Mathematics questions on selected topic and outputs the weightage of each topic .

Ex:

      Suppose we have 3 questions

      Q1.Find the probability of heads when a coin is flip.

      Q2.Find the subset of the given set A = {1,2,3,4}

      Q3.Find the real part of the 2+3i

      Q4.Find the probability of winning a game if it is given that probability of win is 1

Then the model will try to find which question belong to which question using naive bayes and calculate number of questions from each topic that is in our example 

Topic               Number of question

Probability              2

Sets                        1

Complex number    1

## OUTPUT

After the processing the model will convert this data into percentage

that is

Topic           Weightage(%)

Probability           50

Sets                     25

Complex number 25
